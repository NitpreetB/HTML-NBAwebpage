        <h1 class="NBA" >The ABA</h1>

<div1>
      <p2> The American Basketball Association (ABA) was an American semi-professional men's basketball minor league that was founded in 1999, an is essentually the precursor to the NBA
        The ABA has teams based in the United States and previously had international teams based in Canada and Mexico. In the past, there were traveling teams from countries such as Australia and Japan who played in the ABA. Additionally, there were players from other countries that were on a U.S. team to showcase other talented athletes in the country.
        The current ABA bears no relation to the original American Basketball Association (1967 to 1976) that was considered a major league, and merged with the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1976.
